  離職理由
  核聚股份有限公司 資料分析師
  【離職理由】公司方針有改變，重心轉移中國
  說明：公司原本在台北、香港及上海設有辦公室，今年額外在北京開設了新據點，在轉移業務過程中，老闆對台北辦公室的願景及未來發展交代不清，導致與我同屬IT部門協作的同事們陸續離職，在我與老闆面談討論工作規劃等事項仍未獲得明確答覆，因此決定離職，整體IT部門離職比例達八成。

  【離職理由】公司規劃轉換職務(集團其他公司)
  說明：入職時，老闆交付兩份職能，一份是專案的整合管理以及營運分析，另一份偏向公司集團管理及財務會計處理，在年度會談時，老闆希望調整職能，將我轉為集團管理部的小主管職位，管理財務及會計等公司財務的例行事務，專案管理部分就我建立起的整合架構，調整交還給分公司總監及相對應的專案經理個別負責，在思考職涯時，希望往偏專案、可利用到較多樣分析等較具挑戰性的工作內容發展，決定離職。

- To whom it may concern,
        I am Eric, with a bachelor’s degree in finance from National Taiwan University. I am writing this letter to express my interest in your post on 104 website for the Project Consultant position. I consider myself a goal-oriented and self-motivated person, and I am excited to showcase my comprehensive competency with you.
  
        I worked as a data analyst for one of the biggest ESOP service distributor companies in Asia. I was responsible for digging into user needs and turning their thoughts into reality by writing SQL scripts. I conducted customized stock-based compensation reports for key customers, such as JD Group, Meituan, and DiDi. In addition, since the data processing procedure was not well-standardized, I designed the automated workflow to ensure efficiency in the following maintenance.
  
        I started out my career as a financial specialist and have taken several business positions, which equip myself with solid foundation of EXCEL Macro, EXCEL VBA, Tableau, and Canva, excellent presentation skills, and cross-functional communication in teamwork. Even though after a career change, besides writing codes primarily, I tend to pay close attention to project needs.
  
        Throughout my career, gradually I have come to realize a good report, though already with accuracy and readability, often fails to provide consistency and scalability. After browsing the promotional videos and articles, I believe the release of TM1 can make up for it and help users achieve the requirements of a good report with ease. I am eager to bring my analytical capability along with with the Microsoft Visual Studio's experience to your esteemed company.
        I believe my personal traits, qualifications, and work experience make me a suitable candidate for the position. I am looking forward to knowing more about this opportunity and I will be happy to answer more questions.
  
  Sincerely,
  Eric Hsiao

- Mostly as a report provider and reviewer in my career, I got an epiphany of a "good report" not only revealed by its efficiency, accountability and readability, but also its consistency, reliability, and scalability. With a planning analytics software like TM1, People could be easier to achieve the requirements of a "good report". 
  
  I am eager to bring my analytical capability along with the Microsoft Visual Studio's experience to your esteemed company.
  身為報表的提供者，深刻體會到好的報表必須兼顧正確性、易讀性、效率、但容易忽略可擴充性以及報表的延續性。此時一套好的報表開發軟體如TM1就可以更輕易的顧及後面提到容易忽略的這幾點，
  
  在了解IBM TM1以及Microsoft Visual Studio
  
  
  the debut of AFTEE's "Buy Now, Pay Later"  on Pchome in 2019 and then tried it immediately. The smooth user experience impressed me, and deep down I believe the product will achieve technological breakthrough in Taiwan.

  I believe my personal traits, qualifications, and work experience make me a suitable candidate for the position. I am looking forward to knowing more about this opportunity and I will be happy to answer more questions.

- TM1面試準備
## 財務部的創新又會是什麼?

雖然上面說了很多打擊大家的話，但我覺得財務部還是可以做創新的，只是不是大家過往想的賈伯斯發明i-phone這種創舉，而是比較多流程或者是更好的support前端業務單位的方式，像是現今很流行的finance business partner，這個又比傳統FP&A更被要求跟營運單位有更密切的合作。

而近幾年因大數據的興起，我覺得在財務領域的創新會在於資料流程設計與自動化(RPA)，以達到更靈活的財務模擬預測與調整，因為當今世界變化的速度之快，如果公司在系統與資料庫沒有完善的規劃，當大難來臨的時候是很難快速反應的，因為無法及時算出影響並做模擬，而看不清前面的方向。
